### Hi there 👋

My name is Amaury from France, near Lyon. I'm a Geographic Information System specialist and a developer.

- ❤️ I enjoy playing with data, database (SQL 😍), Python and cartography (web). 
- 🍀 I promote quality : testing is mandatory for me!
- ⛱️ I'm taking a lot of fun to play with TypeScript and Angular.
- 🤓 I'm currently learning C++.
